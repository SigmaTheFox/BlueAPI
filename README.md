### Contribute
It currently doesn't matter if the code looks ugly, but all I ask for is to at least keep the formatting and the coding style consistent.
I recommend using inspect element on https://bluearchive.wiki itself while writing the regex, as the data in the json file is unformatted and really hard to read
